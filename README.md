🏥 Hospital Data Analysis & Predictive Modeling

This project focuses on analyzing hospital-related data and building predictive models to assist healthcare providers in making data-driven decisions. It includes data cleaning, visualization, feature engineering, and training machine learning models to predict patient outcomes.


📊 Project Goals

📂 Load and clean real-world hospital datasets
📈 Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
🧠 Train and evaluate machine learning models
🩺 Predict outcomes like:
Hospital readmission
Patient survival
Disease diagnosis
Length of stay
📉 Provide insights to optimize healthcare delivery



🛠️ Technologies Used

Python 3.x
Pandas – Data wrangling
NumPy – Numerical operations
Matplotlib / Seaborn – Data visualization
Scikit-learn – Machine learning
XGBoost / LightGBM – Advanced modeling (optional)
Jupyter Notebook – Interactive development
(Optional: TensorFlow / PyTorch for deep learning tasks)
